Description:
 For this project I made a air quality app that checks the air quality of the zip code you input. It Shows six key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂, SO₂, CO) in a list with their AQI values. I localiuzed my code in 3 languages french english and spanish. I made an about button that takes you to the InfoView that has all the required elements. For my settings view users can change the color mode, language, enable notifactions, and set a permanent zipcode that always displays when they load up the app. users can also click on each pollutent that has data for the city they inputed to get a detailview.
Custom features (if applicable):

 my custom feature is The colorForCategory(_:) function which provides users with visually appealing, category‑specific color logic
